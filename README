npm i

For public consumption, there are two primary things you'll want to be able to do:

1) Create payer & receiver addresses (SOL and SPL ATAs)
This requires creating mints. See instructions in create-acceptance-address-and-atas.md

2) Pay
See pay.md

Extra functionality:
1) Display keypair (display-keypair.js). Import a private key (num arr) from your secret keys, and name it 'id'
2) Move SOL around (sol-transfer-utility.js). This is more for if you've hit your airdrop limits and need to move SOL from one account to another. This could happen if you generate new payer & receiver addresses.
Import the "FROM" private key as "fromPrivateKey".
Import the "TO" private key as "toPrivateKey"
